// The console object gives you access to the browser console

// This console allows the developers to log certain results and alerts and warnings to the screen

// The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser.

// What is window Object?
// Window Object is supplied by what is known as the browser Object Model or you can say for short as BOM

// the window object represents the browser window or, more broadly, the global execution context in which JavaScript code runs. 
// It is a top-level object in the browser's JavaScript environment and serves as the global object for JavaScript code running in a web browser.

// The window object provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser window, such as the document object 
// (window.document), which represents the DOM (Document Object Model) of the currently loaded web page. 
// Additionally, window contains other properties like location, history, navigator, and methods like alert(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().

// Since window is the global object in the browser environment, you can access its properties and methods directly without specifying window 
// explicitly. For example, window.alert("Hello") and alert("Hello") are equivalent.

// // Accessing window properties
// console.log(window.innerWidth); // Current inner width of the browser window
// console.log(window.location.href); // Current URL of the page

// // Accessing window methods
// window.alert("This is an alert!"); // Displays an alert dialog


// window object is the root element of the whole Website 
//  window provides two broad categories of functionality to us 

//  It provides us with the document. Document means it's the website like titles on the screen, buttons we can click on etc.
